Tips on the analytics
- Merchant
You know there is 3 types of analytics to view
Daily, Weekly and Monthly
(Users should be able to select the week they  want to view fro weekly, the date for daily, and the month for monthly)

The heading before the stat shows should be the logistics company the stats are coming from
For weekly you can see
Total number of deliveries
Total POD (Payment on Delivery, this is the actually amount in the order)
Total Remittance
Total Charges
Total locations
Total deliveries in each location
eg Warri 10, Asabs 6, Benin 7 e.t.c
If they have multiple logistics, the above stat should repeat for the other logistics

For monthly you repeat the same thing

While for daily the view would be very different, the analytics page would always be set at daily by default

Firstly the heading showing the name of the logsitics its pulling the stats from
Then a table
Customer name, POD, Charge, Remit

Then at the table base, theres a total Remittance

Then something like a button to view receipt and maybe somekind of UI to element to indicate if the receipt has been sent or not

The stats from weekly can repeat it self like Total deliveries in each location
eg Warri 2, Asaba 1, Benin 2 e.t.c (the daily deliveries are usually small)
If they have multiple logistics, the above stats should repeat for the other logistics

I know you might be worries this data would be plenty and users might need to scroll too much, I don't know how youre gonna make this work üòê

Not to mention you might need to use graphs or charts to represent some things
